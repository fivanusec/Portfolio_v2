I started my journey at the age of 18 when I first learned programming working on Arduino and Arduino-based systems. Why Arduino? I went to engineering school and studied electrical engineering. After I finished In high school, I started college for electrical engineering and along the way, I found that I was more into software than into electrical engineering so I decided to switch college to telematics which I found to be more fun and challenging than electrical engineering."

I love to work in Typescript/Javascript for web development as they are super easy to work with but sometimes I will lean on python if I see I can do something better with it. You never know. I still do a lot of C/C++ as I started with C in high school and nostaliga hits sometimes bad.",
